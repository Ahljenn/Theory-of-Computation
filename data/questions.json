    "question": "What is a regular language?",
    "answer": "A language is regular iff it is decided by some DFA. A language is regular if it's decided by some NFA, or represented by some regular expression"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the three factors of runtime?",
      "answer": "Dependence on hardware. Dependence on easy or hard input. Dependence on length of the input"

      "question": "What is a verifier?",
      "answer": "A program that checks solutions to computation problems"
    },

      "question": "Why are PolyCheck and NPoly identical?",
      "answer": "PolyCheck is in NPoly, and vice versa"

      "question": "Which complexity class does not depend on the type of computational model used?",
      "answer": "O(1) - Constant Time"

      "question": "What does it mean if F 'reduces' to G?",
      "answer": "F can be solved if G can be solved; F is no harder than G"
